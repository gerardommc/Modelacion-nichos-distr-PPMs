	abstract = {Estimation of the dimensions of fundamental ecological niches of species to predict their geographic distributions is increasingly being attempted in systematics, ecology, conservation, public health, etc. This technique is often (of necessity) based on data comprising records of presences only. In recent years, modeling approaches have been devised to estimate these interrelated expressions of a species' ecology, distributional biology, and evolutionary history—nevertheless, a formal basis in ecological and evolutionary theory has largely been lacking. In this paper, we outline such a formal basis to clarify the use of techniques applied to the challenge of estimating ‘ecological niches;' we analyze example situations that can be modeled using these techniques, and clarify interpretation of results},

	abstract = {1. Presence-only data are widely used for species distribution modelling, and point process regression models are a flexible tool that has considerable potential for this problem, when data arise as point events. 2. In this paper, we review point process models, some of their advantages and some common methods of fitting them to presence-only data. 3. Advantages include (and are not limited to) clarification of what the response variable is that is modelled; a framework for choosing the number and location of quadrature points (commonly referred to as pseudo-absences or 'background points') objectively; clarity of model assumptions and tools for checking them; models to handle spatial dependence between points when it is present; and ways forward regarding difficult issues such as accounting for sampling bias. 4. Point process models are related to some common approaches to presence-only species distribution model-ling, which means that a variety of different software tools can be used to fit these models, including MAXENT or generalised linear modelling software.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new Markov point process that exhibits a range of clustered, random, and ordered patterns according to the value of a scalar parameter. In contrast to pairwise interaction processes, this model has interaction terms of all orders. The likelihood is closely related to the empty space functionF, paralleling the relation between the Strauss process and Ripley'sK-function. We show that, in complete analogy with pairwise interaction processes, the pseudolikelihood equations for this model are a special case of the Takacs-Fiksel method, and our model is the limit of a sequence of auto-logistic lattice processes.},
